# TradeMarks dataset

The European Union Intellectual Property Office offers their database of images and metadata of trade marks registered in the EU and International Registrations designating the EU. You can download this database from [EUIPO’s Open Data Platform](https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/es/open-data)

I have downloaded and curated this database in order to build a data set of labeled figurative trade marks, which I have named \emph{TradeMarks2020 data set}, as it include figurative trade marks with filing date before 5th March 2020 (downloaded on 17 March 2020), once removed those without assigned labels.
